## API Rate Limiting Strategy

### Yahoo Finance (Unofficial)
- **Limit**: ~2,000 requests/hour (soft limit)
- **Strategy**: 
  - Cache aggressively (15-30 min for quotes, 24h for fundamentals)
  - Batch requests where possible
  - Implement exponential backoff

### NewsAPI.org
- **Free Tier**: 100 requests/day
- **Strategy**:
  - Fetch news every 2 hours
  - Cache for 6 hours
  - Prioritize high-impact stocks

### Reddit API
- **Limit**: 60 requests/minute
- **Strategy**:
  - Poll every 5 minutes
  - Focus on top posts only
  - Implement webhook if available

### Polygon.io (Free Tier)
- **Limit**: 5 API calls/minute
- **Strategy**:
  - Use for critical real-time data only
  - Implement request queue
  - WebSocket for streaming when possible

## Conclusion

**Yahoo Finance API can provide 70-80% of required data** for StockSense Pro. The main gaps are:
- Real-time streaming (15-20 min delay)
- Social media sentiment (not available)
- Pre-calculated technical indicators (raw data only)
- Advanced news sentiment (basic news only)

All gaps can be addressed through:
1. **Free alternatives** (Reddit, StockTwits, server-side calculations)
2. **Paid upgrades** (Polygon.io, NewsAPI) for production
3. **Custom implementation** (ML models, technical indicators)

The proposed hybrid approach balances cost, functionality, and scalability.
